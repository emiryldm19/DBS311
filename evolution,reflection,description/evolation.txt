Evaluation Criteria Responses
1. Correctness: Does your code work as expected?

Yes, the code works as expected.
The RESTful API has been successfully implemented and tested using Postman, with all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functioning correctly.
The MongoDB database correctly stores and retrieves student records, with indexing and validation ensuring efficient and accurate data operations.
The dynamic leaderboard correctly calculates and displays the top 10 students based on their average grades.
2. Optimization: Have you successfully improved query performance?

Yes, query performance has been optimized.
Indexes were created on key fields (name, email, enrollment_date) in the student_records collection to significantly improve query performance. This ensures that searches by these fields are executed quickly and efficiently.
The use of MongoDB's aggregation framework allows for efficient computation of average grades and other statistics, further optimizing the performance of data retrieval operations.
3. Data Integrity: Is your schema validation thorough?

Yes, schema validation is thorough.
Schema validation was implemented to ensure that all student records adhere to the expected format. This includes:
Ensuring that the email field contains a valid email format.
Validating that the age field is within a reasonable range (e.g., 18-30).
Restricting the status field to predefined values such as "active", "graduated", and "dropped".
Validation rules prevent invalid data from being inserted into the database, maintaining the integrity of the data.
4. Documentation: Are your API endpoints and charts well-documented?

Yes, the API endpoints and charts are well-documented.
A comprehensive README.md file has been created, detailing how to set up and run the project, as well as explaining the purpose and functionality of each API endpoint.
The chart-descriptions.md file provides detailed descriptions and insights for each chart created in MongoDB Charts, helping users understand the visualized data.
Code comments and logical structuring within the server.js file further aid in the clarity and maintainability of the project.
5. Creativity: Have you gone above and beyond to make your submission unique and engaging?

Yes, the submission demonstrates creativity and engagement.
The project not only meets the basic requirements but also includes additional features, such as a dynamic leaderboard web application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with student data.
The use of MongoDB Charts adds a visual dimension to the project, making the data more accessible and insightful.
Thoughtful consideration was given to the design and implementation of the project, ensuring it is both functional and user-friendly, which reflects a high level of creativity and engagement.
Conclusion
Overall, the project meets or exceeds the evaluation criteria. The code is correct, optimized, and well-documented, with thorough data validation ensuring integrity. Creative features like the dynamic leaderboard and detailed data visualizations make the submission unique and engaging.
